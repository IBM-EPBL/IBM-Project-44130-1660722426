Predicting the energy output of wind turbine based on weather condition

Team ID
PNT2022TMID53075

Project Overview
Wind power generation differs from conventional thermal generation due to the stochastic nature
of wind. Thus wind power forecasting plays a key role in dealing with the challenges of balancing
supply and demand in any electricity system, given the uncertainty associated with the wind farm
power output. Accurate wind power forecasting reduces the need for additional balancing energy and
reserve power to integrate wind power. For a wind farm that converts wind energy into electricity power,
a real-time prediction system of the output power is significant. In this project, a prediction system
is developed with a method of combining statistical models and physical models. In this system, the inlet
condition of the wind farm is forecasted by the auto regressive model.

Our Solution
Wind energy is a significant and eligible source that has the potential for producing energy in a
continuous and sustainable manner among renewable energy sources. However, wind energy has several 
challenges, such as initial investment costs, the stationary property of wind plants, and the difficulty
in finding wind-efficient energy areas. Hence, long-term wind power forecasting is to be performed based
on daily wind speed data using machine learning algorithms. With the process of applying machine learning
models along with statistical models to historical wind speed data of a region, we can obtain long-term wind
power values. The model is trained using IBM Watson’s machine learning service and its scoring endpoint is
fed to the application developed using the Flask framework to process the API’s and energy prediction requests
from the user to render the results on the UI.
